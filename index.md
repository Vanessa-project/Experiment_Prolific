## Calculation of the donation amount
 <ul>
  <li>600 participants took part in the study.</li>
  <li>402 individuals decided not to buy the product.</li>
  <li>For every participant that had decided not to buy the product, we donated £1.20/1.40€ to Compensators*, which leads to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of about 30.80 kg. </li>
    <li>In total, we donated 562.80 € to Compensators*, as you can verify in the donation receipt above.</li>
      <li>The total donation leads to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 12,381 kg. </li>
</ul>
