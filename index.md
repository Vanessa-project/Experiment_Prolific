## Calculation of the donation amount

600 paticipants took part in the study.
XX individuals decided to not buy the product, which resulted in a average donation of £1.20/1.38€. 
Therefore, we as the experimenter donated XXX € to [Compensators*](https://www.compensators.org/), as you can see in the donation receipt above.
This leads to a reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by XXX kg.
