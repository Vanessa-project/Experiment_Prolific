# Verify the donation to Compensators* from the Prolific study "Study on decision making"


Thank you for participating in the study by Clara Ulmer from Ulm University and Vanessa Schoeller from the University of Regensburg. 
With your participation in this study, you support our research on the effectiveness of different types of information on carbon emissions, for example as carbon labels on products.

On this page you find information about the total amount of carbon emissions that was eliminated by this study, as well as a donation receipt.

## Calculation of the donation amount
 <ul>
  <li>600 participants took part in the study.</li>
  <li>402 individuals decided not to buy the product.</li>
  <li>For every participant that had decided not to buy the product, we reduced CO2 emissions by about 30.80 kg by donating £1.20/1.40€ to Compensators*. </li>
    <li>In total, participants' decisions resulted in a reduction in CO2 emissions by 12.38 tons as you can verify with the donation receipt above.</li>
      <li>In sum, we donated 562.80 € to Compensators*. </li>
</ul>
